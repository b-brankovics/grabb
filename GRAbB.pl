## This program let's you selcetively assemble parts of a genome from raw reads. The program works in an    ##
## iterative fashon: finds reads that match to bait/reference using exact kmer match, assembles the reads   ##
## de novo.                                                                                                 ##
## For more information read the documentation or the usage message bellow (also by invoking the program    ##
## without any arguments.                                                                                   ##
